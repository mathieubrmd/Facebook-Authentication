# Facebook-Authentication

A very basic Facebook Login and Graph API project in JavaScript.

This app displays some user information and the last posts from Facebook API.

# Demo not available

The demo is not available yet and may never be. I have to be approved by Facebook and this basic app was just for me a way to learn how to use the Facebook API. 

Here is two screenshots from the Website :
